# Insapsula Cookie Generator
## What is Incapsula?
Incapsula is a antibot service. They load a JS file into the browser and collect user data.
Once they collected all the data they encrypt it and make it into a cookie to validate your session.

## How do I collect my own user data?
In the ``./Collector`` folder you can find a index.html file. Simply just open it in
your browser and you will see all your collector user data.

## How do I typecheck the code?
You need to insall mypy first.

```mypy --config-file mypy.conf --install-types main.py```

## **UPDATE 18/06/23**
I do not see __utmvc on a lot of sites anymore, anyway if someone needs __utmvc or reese send me a message.
